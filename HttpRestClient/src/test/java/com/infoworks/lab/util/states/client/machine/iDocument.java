 * You can also apply this approach to objects. Imagine that we have a Document class.
 * A document can be in one of three states: Draft, Moderation and Published.
 * The publish method of the document works a little bit differently in each state:
 *
 *     In Draft, it moves the document to moderation.
 *     In Moderation, it makes the document public, but only if the current user is an administrator.
 *     In Published, it doesnâ€™t do anything at all.
